# *A Midsummer Night's Dream's* Earliest Performances on Stage

The exact date of the first performance of *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* is not known, but most scholars place an estimate between 1595 and 1596. 

## Private Performance 

The earliest performance was most likely “the wedding in 1596 of Elizabeth Carey to Thomas, son of Lord Berkeley at the Blackfriars house of the bride’s father, Sir George Carey” ("A Midsummer Night's Dream - Shakespeare In Quarto"). The fact that the story begins with Theseus and Hippolyta discussing their “nuptial hour” and ends with the matrimony of three couples would have played quite nicely at a celebration of real-life wedding. (Figure 1)

### How Could it Have Been Staged?

In these circumstances, the performance would have been limited in its playing space. A raised bare stage and rear curtain might have been all the players had to help tell their story. Like all of Shakespeare’s plays, the words spoken in the script are used to help the audience forgo their disbelief and imagine the world of the play.  
 
For example, in the opening of Act II of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the Fairy says her/his job is “To dew her orbs upon the green” (2.1.9). In this, the audience can suppose a setting that takes place overnight when grass collects dew. Likewise, when Oberon enters the scene, he says that he and Titania are “Ill met by moonlight” (2.1.61). In this way, the early audiences who might witness the scene outside during the day after wedding festivities could picture the dark night, even though they see a sunny day. 

In Act II scene 1, Oberon describes all the floral canopy of Titania’s bower as a “bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet muskroses, and with eglantine” (2.1.257). By describing the scene with words, the audience would have been able to envision the bower even with limited scenery and props.  

## Public Performance

From the title page of the play in Shakespeare’s First Quarto (Figure 2), it is clear the play has been publicly performed several (or sundry) times by 1600. So, it is important to see where The Lord Chamberlain’s Men might have staged these performances in publicly, not just private gatherings like weddings or other exclusive events.

Although Shakespeare’s troupe is often associated with The Globe, that playhouse was not built until 1599. They also had previous performances in the courtyard at the Cross Key Inn (Figure 3).  However, by 1594, The Theatre and The Rose were licensed as the only two officially legal playhouses in London and plays were no longer allowed at Cross Key Inn (Egan and Gurr). 
This narrows down the most likely public performance to be held at The Theatre, a playhouse situated in Shoreditch, which was owned by actor Richard Burbage’s father.  ("Lord Chamberlain’s Men”) or The Curtain, also just outside the City of London.

## The Theatre

The Theatre was built in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law John Brayne. Most believe The Theatre was built very much in the style seen in The Globe, a “Wooden O” shape with tiered levels of seating, an open yard for standing room, an elevated stage with curtains for entrances and exits upstage. (Figure 4)

It was home to many acting companies, but was used primarily by Shakespeare's acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, after 1594 (Mabillard). This would make it a likely place for a public performance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream if one agrees that the play was written around 1595. But the window of opportunity for public performances at The Theatre is slim due to its closing in 1597. Towards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. In order to save their investment in the property, Burbage and Brayne, with the help of a small group of workmen and chief carpenter Peter Smith, had The Theatre taken down, moved all the pieces across The Thames River, and used the beams to construct the first Globe Theatre (“Elizabethan Theatres”). In doing so, they created another playhouse outside of the city of London where the authorities could not enforce their strict and often arbitrary closures. In fact, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men could not have occupied a London theatre at the time because a production of Thomas Nashe's play Isle of Dogs caused the authorities to decry that it was “seditious” and shut down all of London’s theatres (Mabillard).

### The Curtain

The curtain was a purpose-built playhouse. Its purpose was for the performance of plays, and it seems to have been used by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men for performances between the end of the lease on The Theatre in 1597 and the opening of the Globe in 1599 (Goff). (Figure 5)

Thanks to Museum of London Archaeology’s excavation in 2011, modern scholars and students have many details that explain the shape and structure of one of Shakespeare’s celebrated playhouses. Similar to The Globe or The Theatre, The Curtain had galleries with “mid and upper areas for those who could afford to spend a little more, and a courtyard made from compacted gravel for those with less to spend. ("Archaeologists Uncover the Stage and Other Treasures at Shakespeare’s Curtain Theatre”).  
 
However, The Curtain had some features that distinguish it from the other two playhouses mentioned. First, The Curtain was not a polygon or an “O” shape design. Even though Shakespeare’s Henry V played here, the description of “this wooden O” doesn’t hold true to The Curtain based on the archeological footprint of the structure.  “Our archaeologists can now show that the playhouse appears to be a rectangular building, measuring approximately 22m x 30m (approximately 72’ x 98’), rather than being polygonal ("Initial Findings from Excavation at Shakespeare’s Curtain Theatre Revealed"). Second, the dig has given us new information about a series of tunnels under the stage. “MOLA’s excavation shows that the Curtain featured a hidden passageway under the stage where actors could move undetected” (Brown). Thinking about the blocking for A Midsummer Night’s Dream, imagine how many instances where this disappearing on one side and reappearing on the other could have been useful for characters in this play. Perhaps Oberon used it to appear almost out of nowhere or Puck leads the young lovers through the fog to their slumbers. 
 
Some of the information about The Curtain can be found in writings of plays that were intended to be performed there. A stage direction from Hector of Germany, a piece by Wentworth Smith that played at The Curtain, says to “sit on the rails.” “These rails may be an early occurrence of the sort of small rails seen at the front edge of indoor stages in the 1630s and 40s” (Lueger). 

## Conclusion

Without definitive answers to when and where all the performances of *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* took place prior to 1600, we have to narrow down our focus to the potential public and private opportunities for performance. From weddings of England’s upper class to The Theatre and The Curtain for audiences of all classes and types, as we learn more of the playing and practices of their time, may we re-envision and reestablish *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* for future generations of theatregoers.  

## For Your Production

Whether you have a modern stage with elaborate scenery and set pieces or a simple, bare stage, explore all the ways you can use Shakespeare’s language and description of environments in the play to transport your audience to the imagined worlds of palace, wood, and fairy kingdom. 
 
Examine how you can use the architecture of your playing space to add to the “fairy magic” of the play with surprising entrances like the ones that might have occurred at The Curtain. Even if you don’t have an under-stage series of tunnels, can you have actors appear and reappear quickly in a new location?
