## *A Midsummer Night's Dream's* Earliest Performances on Stage
The exact date of the first performance of *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* is not known, but most scholars place an estimate between 1595 and 1596. 


#### Private Performance 
The earliest performance was most likely “the wedding in 1596 of Elizabeth Carey to Thomas, son of Lord Berkeley at the Blackfriars house of the bride’s father, Sir George Carey” ("A Midsummer Night's Dream - Shakespeare In Quarto"). The fact that the story begins with Theseus and Hippolyta discussing their “nuptial hour” and ends with the matrimony of three couples would have played quite nicely at a celebration of real-life wedding.
