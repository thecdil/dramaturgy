## About Autumn

{% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="midsummer0067" %} 

My name is Autumn and I have always loved Shakespeare! In middle school, I was the nerd reading *Romeo and Juliet* for fun, and in high school, I lived in Europe and was lucky enough to see a few shows at the Globe, cementing my deep love for theatre. During undergrad, I studied Art and Education, but I kept feeling like something was missing, so I went back to school and got another degree in Drama and Musical Theatre in Nashville, TN! When I was there, I was chosen for the Nashville Shakespeare Festival’s Apprentice Company, where I spent about 5 months intensely studying physical and classical theatre techniques, performing 2 professional shows in repertory. It was an incredible experience and I’ve continued to study Shakespeare, perform professionally, and teach what I know to anyone who is excited to learn! Right now, I am combining all the things I love and am studying to get my Master’s Degree in Directing. I hope through my short videos and blurbs you can learn something new, and who knows, maybe you’ll fall in love with Shakespeare too! 

## A Short Disclaimer

The reality is that everyone has a different interpretation of how to perform Shakespeare: some approaches focus on the voice, some focus on the text, some the relationship between actor and audience. The truth is, they are all legitimate. There is no one correct way to do Shakespeare, so take some of that pressure off yourself to be perfect.

This page is not at all meant to tear down any approach but rather to build an understanding of how to act Shakespeare for someone with little-to-no previous experience. This series was developed using tools from my own training and experience and it might differ from the next Shakespeare professional’s advice. What matters is that *you* find the best way that you connect with the text and breathe life and energy into it! The good news is that we all get to learn and try something new!

## How to Warm up for a Shakespearean Performance

When it comes to Shakespearean performance, the warm-up is **not to be skipped!** I say this with all the experience of having skipped my own warm-ups and regretting that fact wholeheartedly, so pretty please learn from my mistakes and do your best to physically and vocally warm up before every rehearsal and performance. 

Shakespeare’s texts can be incredibly dense so you want to make sure you’re prepared for whatever is thrown your way. Here are some great vocal warmups to help you prepare your face, mouth, and tongue for the adventure that lies ahead. I’ve created a video and text guide to lead you through my basic warm-up.

**The Vocal Warm-up**

**The Physical Warm-up**

Once you’ve completed your facial warm-up, it’s time to move on to a whole body warm-up. I didn’t include a video for this one because it’s important for you to take ownership of the songs that you want to include and the physical movements you prefer. I’ve included my personal warm-up, but feel free to add anything you think might help or make changes to anything. Just remember what’s most important: getting yourself physically ready to jump into character! 

1. Pick 4-5 upbeat songs and make a warmup playlist. Get it playing and let’s begin! 

2. Find about 3 feet of space around you and then start stepping side to side, toe-touching on the beat. Once you’ve gotten into your groove, raise your arms “scarecrow style” and start doing the following arm movements, maintaining your toe-touching throughout! Try to do them each for about 20 seconds without giving your arms a break in between.

- Make loose fists and start small arm circles forward, gradually making the circles larger
- Switch to small arm circles backwards and gradually make the circles larger
- Keeping the scarecrow stance, flatten your hands and face your palms backward (thumbs down), then bounce them off of an imaginary wall behind you
- Keeping the scarecrow stance, Imagine a doorknob in each hand and turn them back and forth with tense fingers
- Keeping the scarecrow stance, make each hand a thumbs down, then bounce your arms up and down 
- Keeping the scarecrow stance BUT letting your arms dangle at the elbow, switch to jumping side to side on the beat

3. Shake your arms out and switch to doing squats! This should give your arms a break and work those thighs, each for 20 seconds.
- Regular squats
- Sumo squats (legs out at an angle)
- Pulsing small movement just above normal squat 
- Regular squats, but when you come up adjust the weight to one side and point your toe on the floor

4. Shake your legs out and reach up to the ceiling! Then: 
- Slowly loosen down, eventually finding a frog stance on the floor
- Move into alternating Cat and Cow yoga poses
- Child’s pose
- Frog again, then stick your behind in the air and slowly roll up, one vertebrae at a time
- Find and hold center, breathing in and out for a minute with eyes closed

5. Finally, I finish with a few high energy things to make sure my blood is pumping! I try to do 30 seconds each.
- High knees
- butt kicks 
- Jumping Jacks
- Final 8 count “shake down” of arms and legs
