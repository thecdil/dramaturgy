## About Autumn

My name is Autumn and I have always loved Shakespeare! In middle school, I was the nerd reading *Romeo and Juliet* for fun, and in high school, I lived in Europe and was lucky enough to see a few shows at the Globe, cementing my deep love for theatre. During undergrad, I studied Art and Education, but I kept feeling like something was missing, so I went back to school and got another degree in Drama and Musical Theatre in Nashville, TN! When I was there, I was chosen for the Nashville Shakespeare Festival’s Apprentice Company, where I spent about 5 months intensely studying physical and classical theatre techniques, performing 2 professional shows in repertory. It was an incredible experience and I’ve continued to study Shakespeare, perform professionally, and teach what I know to anyone who is excited to learn! Right now, I am combining all the things I love and am studying to get my Master’s Degree in Directing. I hope through my short videos and blurbs you can learn something new, and who knows, maybe you’ll fall in love with Shakespeare too!
