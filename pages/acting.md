## About Autumn

{% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="midsummer0067" %} 

My name is Autumn and I have always loved Shakespeare! In middle school, I was the nerd reading *Romeo and Juliet* for fun, and in high school, I lived in Europe and was lucky enough to see a few shows at the Globe, cementing my deep love for theatre. During undergrad, I studied Art and Education, but I kept feeling like something was missing, so I went back to school and got another degree in Drama and Musical Theatre in Nashville, TN! When I was there, I was chosen for the Nashville Shakespeare Festival’s Apprentice Company, where I spent about 5 months intensely studying physical and classical theatre techniques, performing 2 professional shows in repertory. It was an incredible experience and I’ve continued to study Shakespeare, perform professionally, and teach what I know to anyone who is excited to learn! Right now, I am combining all the things I love and am studying to get my Master’s Degree in Directing. I hope through my short videos and blurbs you can learn something new, and who knows, maybe you’ll fall in love with Shakespeare too! 

## A Short Disclaimer
The reality is that everyone has a different interpretation of how to perform Shakespeare: some approaches focus on the voice, some focus on the text, some the relationship between actor and audience. The truth is, they are all legitimate. There is no one correct way to do Shakespeare, so take some of that pressure off yourself to be perfect.

This page is not at all meant to tear down any approach but rather to build an understanding of how to act Shakespeare for someone with little-to-no previous experience. This series was developed using tools from my own training and experience and it might differ from the next Shakespeare professional’s advice. What matters is that *you* find the best way that you connect with the text and breathe life and energy into it! The good news is that we all get to learn and try something new!

## How to Use this Page
I’ve broken my teaching into three sections: “How to Warm-up for Shakespearean Performance,” “Tools for Line Delivery,” and “Tools for Decoding Shakespeare.” Here’s a little bit of what is included in each section:

**How to Warm-up for Shakespearean Performance**
- Vocal Warmup 
- Physical Warmup 

**Tools for Shakespearean Line Delivery**
- Performing in “Thought Chunks”
- Thinking on the Line
- Contemporary v. Classical Approaches
- Consonants, Vowels, and Alliteration

**Tools for Decoding Shakespeare**
- Context
- Finding and Using “Operative Words”
- Iambic Pentameter
- Word Structure/Choice 

In each section you’ll find a few short videos of me explaining the idea a little bit further, or giving examples from Shakespearean text. The videos are meant to be short, because the truth is, some of these things are conversations you’ll need to have with your director! I can only give you the basics, but it’s up to you to take it further. The best thing I can recommend is to get your rehearsal clothes on, script out, and pencil ready to take notes! Then when you come across a new idea, you can try it out right away. Let’s dive in, shall we?

## How to Warm up for a Shakespearean Performance
When it comes to Shakespearean performance, the warm-up is **not to be skipped!** I say this with all the experience of having skipped my own warm-ups and regretting that fact wholeheartedly, so pretty please learn from my mistakes and do your best to physically and vocally warm up before every rehearsal and performance. 

Shakespeare’s texts can be incredibly dense so you want to make sure you’re prepared for whatever is thrown your way. Here are some great vocal warmups to help you prepare your face, mouth, and tongue for the adventure that lies ahead. I’ve created a video and text guide to lead you through my basic warm-up.

**The Physical Warm-up**

Once you’ve completed your facial warm-up, it’s time to move on to a whole body warm-up. I didn’t include a video for this one because it’s important for you to take ownership of the songs that you want to include and the physical movements you prefer. I’ve included my personal warm-up, but feel free to add anything you think might help or make changes to anything. Just remember what’s most important: getting yourself physically ready to jump into character! 

1. Pick 4-5 upbeat songs and make a warmup playlist. Get it playing and let’s begin! 

2. Find about 3 feet of space around you and then start stepping side to side, toe-touching on the beat. Once you’ve gotten into your groove, raise your arms “scarecrow style” and start doing the following arm movements, maintaining your toe-touching throughout! Try to do them each for about 20 seconds without giving your arms a break in between.

- Make loose fists and start small arm circles forward, gradually making the circles larger
- Switch to small arm circles backwards and gradually make the circles larger
- Keeping the scarecrow stance, flatten your hands and face your palms backward (thumbs down), then bounce them off of an imaginary wall behind you
- Keeping the scarecrow stance, Imagine a doorknob in each hand and turn them back and forth with tense fingers
- Keeping the scarecrow stance, make each hand a thumbs down, then bounce your arms up and down 
- Keeping the scarecrow stance BUT letting your arms dangle at the elbow, switch to jumping side to side on the beat

3. Shake your arms out and switch to doing squats! This should give your arms a break and work those thighs, each for 20 seconds.
- Regular squats
- Sumo squats (legs out at an angle)
- Pulsing small movement just above normal squat 
- Regular squats, but when you come up adjust the weight to one side and point your toe on the floor

4. Shake your legs out and reach up to the ceiling! Then: 
- Slowly loosen down, eventually finding a frog stance on the floor
- Move into alternating Cat and Cow yoga poses
- Child’s pose
- Frog again, then stick your behind in the air and slowly roll up, one vertebrae at a time
- Find and hold center, breathing in and out for a minute with eyes closed

5. Finally, I finish with a few high energy things to make sure my blood is pumping! I try to do 30 seconds each.
- High knees
- butt kicks 
- Jumping Jacks
- Final 8 count “shake down” of arms and legs

### Thought Chunking

{% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="midsummer0069" %} 

Have you ever seen Shakespeare performed live? There’s the excitement and buzz of the audience, the beautiful set and props onstage, then the actors make their entrance and . . . the audience has no idea what the actors are saying! Don’t worry! This is normal.

Typically, audience ears have to spend about 5-10 minutes adjusting to the sound of classical text; and for some people it may take even longer. Shakespeare used a lot of words to explain his ideas, and it’s pretty easy for audiences to get lost if they aren’t in the habit of attending Shakespearean shows. As actors, it’s our job to make sure that the audience is able to follow the plot no matter what, and that is where “thought chunking” your text is incredibly helpful! 

In monologues, the text usually explores one big idea at a time. Instead of trying to act and emphasize each and every word (that’s exhausting!), try figuring out what the big “idea” is, and see if you can shape your acting choices around the idea, or thought chunk, that needs to be communicated. 

In the video, I approach the first four lines of Portia’s monologue in *The Merchant of Venice:* "The quality of mercy is not strained;/It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven/Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;/It blesseth him that gives and him that takes." 

To me, these first four lines can be broken into two small thought chunks. The first one is about mercy being easy and free (like the rain), and the second begins the discussion of how mercy affects those who give and receive it. Now that I know what it means and what the two thoughts are, I can communicate the thoughts instead of focusing on the exact words that I’m saying. It sounds much more natural, and it helps the audience understand the idea I’m trying to communicate. Did you hear that?

Go through your text and start marking the thought chunks you see with parenthesis. Some ideas build on the last, so your thought chunks may bleed into each other and that’s okay! How will you connect your acting of the thought chunks so the audience sees that connection and build? Some ideas are directly opposing the one that came right before. How can you make it obvious when one idea ends and another starts? 

Thought chunking your text is also an incredibly helpful memorization tool! Instead of trying to remember words that you don’t normally use with your friends, remember the order of thought chunks. Most likely, once you remember the idea, the specific Shakespearean words will follow. 

### Thinking on the Line

{% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="midsummer0070" %} 

We all know Shakespeare can be long-winded but some of his plays are five, even six hours long (and since the majority of his audience was in the pit, they were standing that whole time)! There are some tricks to shortening the run time and keeping everyone interested in the action of the play, one of which is called “thinking on the line.”

Instead of letting the lightbulb moments or motivation happen when it is quiet or by taking a long and thoughtful pause, try “thinking on the line.” This means that the lightbulb goes on *as you say the line.* You are essentially discovering your emotions, ideas, and character as it is all coming out of your mouth. This invigorates the text and forces the actors to energize their words instead of their pauses. 

Here’s why it’s so hard for contemporary actors to embrace this style of acting: it doesn’t feel natural! We’ve been taught to experience emotion and then let the audience see what we’re feeling. There are so many powerful moments in contemporary drama where text is unnecessary: we completely understand the character without them having to use words. If possible, try to think of Shakespearean acting as the *opposite* of that. We have to have the words to know what the character is feeling, and it’s only by using the words that the audience can fully understand what the characters are going through. The other truth is that if Shakespearean actors took the time to more naturally move from one emotion to another, we’d be looking at a twelve hour *Romeo and Juliet.* Nobody wants to sit for that long, so that’s why thinking on the line is a great skill to start trying out!
