## About Autumn

{% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="midsummer0067" %} 

My name is Autumn and I have always loved Shakespeare! In middle school, I was the nerd reading *Romeo and Juliet* for fun, and in high school, I lived in Europe and was lucky enough to see a few shows at the Globe, cementing my deep love for theatre. During undergrad, I studied Art and Education, but I kept feeling like something was missing, so I went back to school and got another degree in Drama and Musical Theatre in Nashville, TN! When I was there, I was chosen for the Nashville Shakespeare Festival’s Apprentice Company, where I spent about 5 months intensely studying physical and classical theatre techniques, performing 2 professional shows in repertory. It was an incredible experience and I’ve continued to study Shakespeare, perform professionally, and teach what I know to anyone who is excited to learn! Right now, I am combining all the things I love and am studying to get my Master’s Degree in Directing. I hope through my short videos and blurbs you can learn something new, and who knows, maybe you’ll fall in love with Shakespeare too! 

## A Short Disclaimer

The reality is that everyone has a different interpretation of how to perform Shakespeare: some approaches focus on the voice, some focus on the text, some the relationship between actor and audience. The truth is, they are all legitimate. There is no one correct way to do Shakespeare, so take some of that pressure off yourself to be perfect.

This page is not at all meant to tear down any approach but rather to build an understanding of how to act Shakespeare for someone with little-to-no previous experience. This series was developed using tools from my own training and experience and it might differ from the next Shakespeare professional’s advice. What matters is that *you* find the best way that you connect with the text and breathe life and energy into it! The good news is that we all get to learn and try something new!

## How to Warm up for a Shakespearean Performance

When it comes to Shakespearean performance, the warm-up is **not to be skipped!** I say this with all the experience of having skipped my own warm-ups and regretting that fact wholeheartedly, so pretty please learn from my mistakes and do your best to physically and vocally warm up before every rehearsal and performance. 

Shakespeare’s texts can be incredibly dense so you want to make sure you’re prepared for whatever is thrown your way. Here are some great vocal warmups to help you prepare your face, mouth, and tongue for the adventure that lies ahead. I’ve created a video and text guide to lead you through my basic warm-up.
